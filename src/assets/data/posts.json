        "text": "I've been learning web development through The Odin Project for the past few months, and it has been a great experience. I've always had a fondness for technology and enjoyed working with computers, so I found myself working through the early material quite easily. After a day or two, I was so excited to already be putting together fully-fledged HTML webpages. Well, early on, the webpages were extremely simple—like two links and a meal prep recipe simple—but everyone has to start somewhere, right?"

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "It took me a little over six months of full-time study to complete the course. As a whole, the course was clear to follow. The only time I felt like I truly had to reach for additional sources to learn the material was during the Data Structures and Algorithms section. JavaScript being my first programming language and me having only just become familiar with it, I soon realized I would have to learn to walk before I could run. So, I found YouTube tutorials, reviewed JavaScript methods, and coded until I became more comfortable."
      },

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "I'll be honest, this wasn't my first time attempting to learn to code. I had tried other sources like Codecademy or trying to teach myself just by reviewing other source code. I never really made it far with those methods. What I really loved about The Odin Project was creating your own environment on your device to do lessons. It felt so much more real when I was actually able to type something in or set a background color—or anything, really—and I could see that happening in the browser. That immediate feedback really resonated with me and motivated me to keep going, even in the desert of despair that learning a programming language sometimes feels like."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Once I finished learning the basics of JavaScript, I was sent down the path of advanced HTML and CSS and then, finally, React. When I first approached the React section of the course, I was not excited at all. I barely understood what a library was, and I questioned why I even needed it. I mean, I could already do so much with vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, and Webpack—why would I need more? Well, React ended up being a huge turning point. It felt amazing; all the individual concepts I had learned over the last few months came together to form something greater. I was all of a sudden building cooler stuff, more easily, and faster than I ever had before. Things just made sense—it was awesome."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "So I cooked with React for a while, dug around, found all the other React libraries and tools, and built a few projects. I was feeling pretty good, but I knew I had to keep going. So, I started digging into the backend. Backend development is something I'm working towards now. I'd like to learn a low-level language—of which I'm still undecided—and apply it to build and maintain robust web applications. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'm grateful for The Odin Project for getting me started."
