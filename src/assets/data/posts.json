I've always had a fondness for technology and enjoyed working with computers, so I found myself working through the early material quite easily. After a day or two, I was so excited to already be putting together fully-fledged HTML webpages. Well, early on, the webpages were extremely simple—like two links and a meal prep recipe simple—but everyone has to start somewhere, right?"

        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "It took me a little over six months of full-time study to complete the course. As a whole, the course was clear to follow. The only time I felt like I truly had to reach for additional sources to learn the material was during the Data Structures and Algorithms section. JavaScript being my first programming language and me having only just become familiar with it, I soon realized I would have to learn to walk before I could run. So, I found YouTube tutorials, reviewed JavaScript methods, and coded until I became more comfortable."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "I'll be honest, this wasn't my first time attempting to learn to code. I had tried other sources like Codecademy or trying to teach myself just by reviewing other source code. I never really made it far with those methods. What I really loved about The Odin Project was creating your own environment on your device to do lessons. It felt so much more real when I was actually able to type something in or set a background color—or anything, really—and I could see that happening in the browser. That immediate feedback really resonated with me and motivated me to keep going, even in the desert of despair that learning a programming language sometimes feels like."

      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "Once I finished learning the basics of JavaScript, I was sent down the path of advanced HTML and CSS and then, finally, React. When I first approached the React section of the course, I was not excited at all. I barely understood what a library was, and I questioned why I even needed it. I mean, I could already do so much with vanilla JS, CSS, HTML, and Webpack—why would I need more? Well, React ended up being a huge turning point. It felt amazing; all the individual concepts I had learned over the last few months came together to form something greater. I was all of a sudden building cooler stuff, more easily, and faster than I ever had before. Things just made sense—it was awesome."
      },
      {
        "type": "paragraph",
        "text": "So I cooked with React for a while, dug around, found all the other React libraries and tools, and built a few projects. I was feeling pretty good, but I knew I had to keep going. So, I started digging into the backend. Backend development is something I'm working towards now. I'd like to learn a low-level language—of which I'm still undecided—and apply it to build and maintain robust web applications. I'm excited to see where this journey takes me, and I'm grateful for The Odin Project for getting me started."

Complicated concepts have been abstracted into frameworks and libraries that do a lot of the heavy lifting in the background. As much as each of these is a massive boon, they also bring with them notable pitfalls."

I went with what seemed like the obvious choices: a Windows PC, VMware for a Linux environment (Ubuntu, duh), and vanilla VS Code (soon to be stuffed with extensions, naturally). All neatly set up within 2 hours of diving into my first course site. All of this was available in some form a decade ago, but it would have taken a lot more effort for a beginner to get going. Why? Two reasons. One, these tools have been streamlined to be extremely accessible. Two, whenever I ran into an issue, I could describe it to ChatGPT. If that didn’t work, I then explained my problem to a Google search bar, which in most instances directed me to a video of someone solving my exact problem. EZ PZ LS. (The LS stands for lemon squeezy, by the way)."

Nothing I was doing was interesting or new, so naturally, there was an abundance of available solutions. But what happens when you reach a point where the problem you’re trying to solve doesn't have a readily available solution from an LLM/blog post/YouTube video? These tools are great at solving problems, but unless you put a concerted effort into understanding what they are doing, you will learn nothing along the way. So then, what happens when you run into a problem that they don’t have a solution for?"

It’s overwhelming, and this is the situation regardless of what area of expertise you choose to specialize in. Do you want to be a software dev, web dev, AI engineer, back-end, front-end, full-stack, cloud, DevOps, or work in embedded systems? Each of these different areas comes with a different set of early instructions. Most beginners probably don’t even know what these paths entail—how could they, unless they had already been tuned into the tech space prior? And at that point, are they truly even beginners?"

The solution to this, and what saved me time and time again in the early stages of learning, was following a course that laid out a pathway and linked to useful resources. This seems like the only option unless you come into the space with a very well-defined goal in mind already."

        "text": "The libraries and frameworks we have today are amazing. Learning React greatly sped up my ability to spin up a basic website. The way it abstracted DOM manipulation just made so much more sense to me than it did in vanilla JavaScript. The functionality and ease of use of these frameworks raise the bar of expectations for websites. People grow accustomed to things looking and working a certain way. That’s natural. But that means to become proficient, a beginner also has to learn and understand a multitude of design patterns that just didn’t exist years ago."

        "text": "There’s also the pitfall of skipping over the basics and jumping directly into a library or framework. Luckily, I was steered strongly away from this early in my learning journey, so I didn’t even consider it an option. Could I have jumped straight into learning React? Yeah. I think I would be far worse off for it today, though. I’ve always had the perspective that fundamentals are extremely important, but it’s also important to get someone building stuff as soon as possible. You learn more by building something you’re interested in than by reading docs or following tutorials, and it’s not even close."
